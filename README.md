# SaveWizard

* Author of original "SaveWizard" script: DrEGZo
* The original script is taken from here: <https://forum.truckersmp.com/index.php?/topic/55773-savewizard/>
* To decrypt the file the utility is used: <https://github.com/ncs-sniper/SII_Decrypt/>

***

This program allows:
1. Decrypt file, if save file crypted
2. Check for DLC to the save file
3. Edit money, experience and loan limit
4. Edit skills
5. Unlock garages, visit cities, unlock dealers and agencies

**This functionality of the program is not final!**

***

#### Since the program is in development, I will not give up help and guidance on my errors in the code.
